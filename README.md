# Introduction
* According to research done by the National Safety Council in 2021, anti-collision systems have the potential to prevent 20,841 deaths per year or about 62% of total traffic deaths. It can also potentially prevent or mitigate 1.69 million injuries (about 60% of total traffic injuries). It can also prevent or mitigate damage to 4.60 million vehicles per year.
* However, these anti-collision systems are limited to newer and more expensive vehicles. As the system is fully integrated with vehicles and manufacturers often charge a premium on the models equipped with this system. 
* This engineering projectâ€™s goal is to develop the prototype of a stand-alone anti-collision system that can be put on any vehicle and cost less than $100 USD.

# Project Description: LiDAR Based Collision Prevention System for Any Vehicles
* This LiDAR Based Collision Prevention System for Any Vehicles is composed of:
* 1) A LiDAR sensor is used to detect the distance of nearby obstacles. 
* 2) A software program is developed on nodeMCU to calculate the speed using the distance measured by the LiDAR and use a preset threshold to determine if a collision is likely to happen or not. If a collision is likely to happen, a buzzer will go off to alert the driver to slow down.
* 3) The distance and speed are also transferred into an IoT platform to enable more smart features in my future research.

The code for nodemcu platform based collision prevention system composed of the following
* 1): an Arduino to develop software program control LiDAR and collect distance measurements
* 2): a mobile APP to process these measurements and trigger warning signals when collision risk is high

This project will enable these measurements.
* 1): Using the sensor to detect an object at a set distance to verify the accuracy of the sensor
* 2): Moving the object at different speed and use the measurements to verify the accuracy of speed and collision risk assessment
* 3): Setting the warning threshold at different level to verify that the mobile APP can respond accordingly
