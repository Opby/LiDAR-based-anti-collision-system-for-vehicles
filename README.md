# LiDAR-based-anti-collision-system-for-vehicles
The code for nodemcu platform based collision prevention system composed of the following
1: a small form factor LiDAR sensor 
2: an Arduino to develop software program control LiDAR and collect distance measurements
3: a mobile APP to process these measurements and trigger warning signals when collision risk is high

This project will enable these measurements.
1: Using the sensor to detect an object at a set distance to verify the accuracy of the sensor
2: Moving the object at different speed and use the measurements to verify the accuracy of speed and collision risk assessment
3: Setting the warning threshold at different level to verify that the mobile APP can respond accordingly
